There weren't really that many of us, just as the Cleansing Flame as a whole was stretched thin across the region.",

Nothing but a fancy way of saying we investigated anomalies in areas where the regular hunters wouldn't exactly blend in.  Generally only the ones trained for getting in somewhere hostile, and dismantling any artifacts they couldn't safely extract, really warranted the title.  But, just as even the smiths and medics are still part of a hunting party, the title gets around."
